## Recent Projects

### Created Engineering Organization at Immertec

I implemented all of the foundational processes and procedures for Immertec's software development life cycle (SDLC) to pass a SOC2 audit. I organized and wrote most of the internal documentation for Engineering including operational documents, onboarding, product, and how-tos. I setup and trained the team on the use of kanban as a development methodology and tracked performance metrics across multiple product lines including web, mobile, VR, and custom systems running in AWS and GCP. Using these metrics and others I created a health reporting dashboard for the weekly executive leadership team to help drive company decision making. I implemented SOC2 compliant source control processes on GitLab while consolidating from GitHub and Bitbucket to reduce costs and developer friction. I implemented behavior driven development (BDD) using CucumberStudio and Browserstack to reduce regressions and improve product quality and speed of development. I setup CI/CD pipelines using GitLab Runners on top of Kubernetes to automate deployment of development, staging, and production applications using Terraform (previously was bespoke and tribal knowledge). I led hiring which tripled the size of the existing Engineering team including the addition of a platform, product, and QA team. I also implemented continuous improvement processes such as biweekly 1:1s, monthly retrospectives, and improvement katas.

### Created Site Reliability Organization at Magic Leap

Starting with just myself, I created an organization of about seventy engineers globally focused on the delivery of technology infrastructure and developer productivity at Magic Leap. We had organized competencies around end-user support, infrastructure engineering, observability, chaos engineering, and application delivery. Most notably I introduced kanban project management methodologies which reduced average lead times from 45 days to 14 days across the team. We also implemented processes for automating the deployment of all physical and virtual infrastructure, removing many bespoke, manual processes.

### Mixed Reality Architecture

Architected, designed, and led a team to develop an application to visualize cloud infrastructure using Spatial Computing (AR/MR) using the Magic Leap One. We used a combination of Unity, C#, Terraform, Golang, and Cloud Storage, and Cloud Functions to dynamically pull infrastructure from a Terraform state and show it using a directed graph. We also leveraged image keys to synchronize location data and share the experience real time with another user.
